# CompArchEsp32Projects
This repo has my basic stage esp32 projects for understand computer architecutere lecture.


ARDUNIO IDE:
Arduino IDE is a simple development environment used to write and upload code to boards like the ESP32.
It is based on C/C++ and uses the setup() and loop() structure. It provides easy access to hardware through ready-to-use libraries.

ESP32:
The ESP32 is a low-power microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
It features a dual-core Xtensa LX6 CPU architecture.
It can run both high-level C/C++ code and low-level assembly instructions.


Xtensa Assembly:
Xtensa Assembly is the native machine instruction set of the ESP32’s Xtensa LX6 processor.
It works directly with registers (a0–a15). It is used for very fast, low-level operations. 
With inline assembly, you can embed small assembly blocks inside C++ code.
